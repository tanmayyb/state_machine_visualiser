Why does this repo exist? </br>
Let's say you need to show what 'state' the rover is in your video project. You want to show what its mind is doing atm. Is it waiting for you to give instructions? Is is scanning it's environment? etc.
You use a state machine to show that. Our webapp emulates a custom state machine with transitionable state, recorder and background transparency functionalities built in.
